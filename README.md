Tips and Best Practices for Java Streams

- Use method references when possible, as they make the code more readable and concise.
- Be cautious with parallel streams, as they can cause unexpected behavior if not used correctly. Only use them when youâ€™re sure your code is thread-safe and you can benefit from parallel processing.
- Limit the use of stateful intermediate operations, as they can affect the performance and parallelism of your streams.
Always close streams that operate on I/O resources, like Files.lines(Path), using the try-with-resources statement to ensure proper resource handling.
